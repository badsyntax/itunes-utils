This small bash script was built to help you manage your iTunes library.

- iTunes must be running before you run this script
- you will need to have the correct file permissions for copying tracks

Some of the features include:

- Viewing an overview of your library
- Converting Tracks
- Creating a backup of your itunes library
- Removing empty directories

The backup feature will copy your tracks into a specified directory in the order of: Genre/Artist/Album/Track

All file modifications are run through iTunes using applescript.
